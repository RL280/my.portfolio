          <h3>Web Portfolio</h3>
          <p>&emsp;Although it is quite simple in nature I did enjoy making this web portfolio, it helped me to brighten my horizons regarding how I perceive projects. The time I took to complete it was sparse but I enjoy every minute of research on my own to find how to propery do things, and css is a very handy and awesome thing.</p>

          <h3>PLC Programming</h3>
          <p>&emsp;For PLC programming classes, one thing that helped me a lot was to be patient and take my time to figure out why something isn't working. I feel quite an easy with it, it is a type of programming that I do enjoy during classes.</p>
